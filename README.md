## Overview

My first challenge on Frontend Mentor website, testing myself to match the design visual. I found it easy to create the elements but tricky to get the detail right, a very good initial introduction and I learned more about the whole process using Git, noting the detail via the Readme and how to consider the whole development process rather than just creating a website for myself.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid


### What I learned

How to centre a div using css grid, very easy! 

```css
.first-row {
  place-self: center;
}
```

### Continued development

More css grid and flexbox. Powerful layout tools but tricky to master.
